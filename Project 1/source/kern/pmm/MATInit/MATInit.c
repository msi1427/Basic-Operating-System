  /** TASK 2:
    * Initialization of the physical allocation table (AT).
    *
    * In CertiKOS, the entire addresses < VM_USERLO or >= VM_USERHI are reserved by the kernel.
    * That corresponds to the physical pages from 0 to VM_USERLO_PI-1, and from VM_USERHI_PI to NUM_PAGES-1.
    * The rest of pages that correspond to addresses [VM_USERLO, VM_USERHI), can be used freely ONLY IF
    * the entire page falls into one of the ranges in the memory map table with the permission marked as usable.
    *
    * Hints:
    * 1. You have to initialize AT for all the page indices from 0 to NPS - 1.
    * 2. For the pages that are reserved by the kernel, simply set its permission to 1.
    *    Recall that the setter at_set_perm also marks the page as unallocated.
    *    Thus, you don't have to call another function to set the allocation flag.
    * 3. For the rest of the pages, explore the memory map table to find the information about the corresponding physical page
    *    and set its permission accordingly.
    *    The permission should be set to 2 only if there is a range containing the entire page that
    *    is marked as available in the memory map table. Otherwise, it should be set to 0.
    *    Note that the ranges in the memory map are not aligned by pages.
    *    So it may be possible that for some pages, only part of the addresses are in the ranges.
    *    Currently, we do not utilize partial pages, so in that case, you should consider those pages as unavailble.
    * 4. Every page in the allocation table should be initialized.
    *    But the ranges in the momory map table may not cover the entire available address space.
    *    That means there may be some gaps between the ranges.
    *    You should still set the permission of those pages in allocation table to 0.
